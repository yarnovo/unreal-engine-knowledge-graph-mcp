学习使用此**Beta**功能，但在发布产品中需要谨慎使用。

The Geometry Scripting library contains a very broad range of functionality, from low-level mesh construction and queries, such as building a mesh triangle-by-triangle or counting its vertices, to high-level operations like mesh booleans and intersection tests.

For more information on using the Geometry Scripting library, see [Geometry Scripting Users Guide](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/geometry-scripting-users-guide-in-unreal-engine).

Most functions are available while working in the editor and at runtime. However, some are only available while working in the editor and have been noted in the tables below.

For more information on the various functions, see the [Blueprint](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/BlueprintAPI/GeometryScript) and [Python](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/PythonAPI/) APIs.

However, a PolyGroup layer is ultimately a per-triangle number, and you can use it for any other purpose. To learn more about PolyGroups see, [Understanding PolyGroups](working-with-content/modeling-and-geometry-scripting/modeling-mode/understanding-polygroups).

## Glossary

Term

Definition

**Overlay**

A data structure representing a type of vertex data applied to a mesh.These types include: vertex color, normal, tangent, and UV.

Multiple values of the specified type can be stored at a single vertex. In such cases, depending on the type, one of the following occurs: the last value is used, the values are averaged, or an arbitrary value is used.

**One-ring**

The neighboring vertices of the selected vertex, connected by an edge.

[![One-ring Triangles](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9f5ba8db-9284-42db-807d-41cd7f2b2834?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9f5ba8db-9284-42db-807d-41cd7f2b2834?resizing_type=fit)

*The one-ring of vertex M.*

**UV Set**

Contains the UV coordinates of a mesh, also referred to as the [UV Channel](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-uv-channels-with-static-meshes-in-unreal-engine). You can use multiple UV Channels to represent different [UV maps](working-with-content/modeling-and-geometry-scripting/modeling-tools/uvs-category#UVMap).

**Extents**

The half-dimensions of a box, measured along the three axes. They are used to determine how much to extend from a center point.

A center point, C, and Extent, E, results in a box with a bottom-left-near corner at `C - E` and a top-right-far corner at `C + E`.
