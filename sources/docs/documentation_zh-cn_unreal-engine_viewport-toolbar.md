When working in the Unreal Editor, there are Level Editor Modes that each have their own workflows, functionality, and toolbar that corresponds to this. This **Viewport Toolbar** is located above the editor viewport, they include quick-select tools and menu options that affect how you interact with objects, the level in general, and what you see there. These viewport toolbar options can change depending on which mode the level editor is currently using.

## Improved Viewport Toolbar versus the Legacy Viewport Toolbar

Unreal Engine 5.6 introduces the improved viewport toolbar that has a new layout that accommodates modern workflows. This viewport toolbar replaces the previous viewport toolbar entirely for the Level Viewport and any other asset editors that also have a viewport.

[![The improved level viewport toolbar in Unreal Engine 5.6 and later compared to the legacy viewport toolbar found in earlier versions of Unreal Engine.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1466b2a4-8d7a-4654-b425-eae11f07c257?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1466b2a4-8d7a-4654-b425-eae11f07c257?resizing_type=fit)

The improved level viewport toolbar in Unreal Engine 5.6 and later compared to the legacy viewport toolbar found in earlier versions of Unreal Engine.

This update to the viewport toolbar provides the following benefits: 

-   It has consistent locations for features ordered by logical categories, such as those for transforms, snapping, and view modes.
    
-   Unification of related tools and options that were previously located in high-level settings dropdowns.
    
-   Better overflow management for smaller viewports as quick-select elements and menu condense and collapse into an overflow menu.
    
-   Unique toolbars for Level Editor Modes and asset editors with their own specific controls.
    
-   User-customizable menus.
    
-   Better extensibility and customization with the \`ToolsMenu\` system.
    

## Viewport Toolbar Interface

The toolbar — whether it’s in the level editor or an asset editor — is located just above the viewport window.

The tools and settings are grouped into the following categories: 

The improved Viewport Toolbar is located at the top of any viewport as a separate toolbar above the viewport window. Its settings and tools are grouped into the following categories:

## Viewport Toolbar Transform & Snapping Tools

The **Transform** and **Snapping** tools make up most of the tools you’ll use to select and manipulate objects within the editor viewport. This includes tools for selection, snapping, space orientation, and quick-select options for the most common ones.

### Transform Tools

The **Transform** **tools** are a set of quick selection tools to move, rotate, and scale objects and set what space (local or world) these should operate in. These options are how you will interact with objects in the level. This part of the toolbar also includes a dropdown menu with additional transform-related options.

[![Viewport transform tools area.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/96df7d16-0702-467e-bd22-c9fcb25f5fcc?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/96df7d16-0702-467e-bd22-c9fcb25f5fcc?resizing_type=fit)

You can use these quick-select toolbar options to manipulate objects in the viewport:

**World Space Coordinates**

**CTRL + \`**

This icon is the coordinate system used for World Space (the entire level), with its origin being the center of the scene (the world grid). This coordinate system is fixed — you cannot transform it. Objects are translated and rotated in absolute units relative to the level’s origin and scale relative to the entire level.

[![Local space coordinates icon](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e2a93a6c-9b8e-4add-8087-13396de886d0?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e2a93a6c-9b8e-4add-8087-13396de886d0?resizing_type=fit)

**Local Space Coordinates**

**CTRL + \`**

This icon is the coordinate system used for Local (Object) Space with its coordinate system relative to the scene component to which the actor is attached. Every actor has a local space coordinate system within a scene relative to the actor’s pivot point. Use local space to translate or rotate an object relative to its parent.

[![Camera movement options menu.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/54670716-fa78-4da2-a267-987244d6a018?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/54670716-fa78-4da2-a267-987244d6a018?resizing_type=fit)

  This section of the menu includes the following settings:

Setting Name

Description

Pilot

**Pilot \[Selected Actor\]**

Move the selected actor around using the viewport controls, and bind the viewport to the actor’s location and orientation.

**Stop Piloting Actor**

When piloting is enabled for an actor, this stops piloting of an actor with the current viewport. It unlocks the viewport’s position and orientation from the actor the viewport is currently piloting.

**Exact Camera View**

Toggles showing the exact camera view when using the viewport to pilot a camera.   

**Selected Piloted Actor**

Selects the currently piloted actor in the Outliner.

Camera Movement

**Camera Speed**

Set the camera speed for movement in the viewport. These options are available from the quick-select toolbar as well.

**Frame Selected**

Centers the viewport on the selected actor(s).

**Move Camera to Object**

Move the current camera to match the location and rotation of the selected object.

**Move Object to Camera**

Move the selected object to match the location and rotation of the current camera.

**Orbit Around Selection**

If enabled, the camera will orbit around the current selection in the viewport. 

**Link Ortho Camera Movement**

If enabled, all orthographic viewports are linked to the same position and move together. When disabled, they move independent of one another.

**Ortho Zoom to Cursor**

If enabled, orthographic viewport zooming centers on the mouse cursor’s position. When disabled, the zoom is around the center of the viewport.

### View Options

The **View** options are available when the viewport is using the **Perspective** view. These options configure the viewing angle of the viewport camera, and at what distance content should be visible from this camera.

[![Image of menu options for field of view.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e0cc14a4-eb26-4b0e-87a7-07e1b7510d41?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e0cc14a4-eb26-4b0e-87a7-07e1b7510d41?resizing_type=fit)

  This section includes the following settings:

Setting Name

Description

**Field of View**

Sets the viewing angle of the viewport camera. This angle defines the extent of the world that is visible to the camera at any given time. The default is a **90 degree** viewing angle. Higher angles give you wider views to see more of the world but this skews the camera view. Lower angles show less of the world, feeling zoomed in, but the view of content is limited. 

**Near View Plane**

Sets the size of the plane used to clip through objects when the camera is close to a surface. Large values make the clip plane bigger to see through objects more easily. 

**Far View Plane**

Sets the far distance at which objects stop being rendered on screen.

This value does not affect objects that have Nanite enabled.

In the example below, you can see how adjusting the field of view angle affectss your view:

## Viewport Toolbar Performance and Scalability Tools

The **Performance** and **Scalability Tool** menu includes options that affect the look and performance of content in the viewport. These tools are useful for approximating what content looks like on a particular platform, setting scalability for the project (to make it easier to work with), and looking at how the game can look with different scalability options. This can help you to set up your own scalability options for your project.

[![Image of scalability menu options on the toolbar.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/fa566a50-d5ba-4818-ae19-f2a9ce25e56e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/fa566a50-d5ba-4818-ae19-f2a9ce25e56e?resizing_type=fit)

### Realtime Viewport

The **Realtime Viewport** toggles whether the current viewport should update every frame.  

When disabled, the viewport only updates when you move around the scene. A warning icon is added to the viewport toolbar next to the performance and scalability dropdown menu. Clicking it restores realtime to the viewport.

[![Image of warning icon next to the realtime viewer.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/31f43d66-398d-496a-818b-edcfb841382c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/31f43d66-398d-496a-818b-edcfb841382c?resizing_type=fit)

### Preview Platform

The **Preview Platform** rollout menu includes a variety of platform options to select from. Selecting platform and its target, triggers a shader recompile for the engine. Once completed, the viewport updates to display an approximation of what the scene would render like using this target. 

Each platform can have multiple targets depending on what rendering paths of the engine it supports.

[![Preview platform menu dropdowns.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8826a8b9-564d-40e8-97e9-e02427de813b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8826a8b9-564d-40e8-97e9-e02427de813b?resizing_type=fit)

### Viewport Layouts and Sizing Settings

The **Viewport Layouts** includes a layouts window to select the type of viewport layout you prefer, and a quick-toggle to switch between a selected layout and maximized viewport screen.

[![Viewport layouts icon and ellipses on the toolbar.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c92f543d-ad68-4845-99c1-5a4739f37ba7?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c92f543d-ad68-4845-99c1-5a4739f37ba7?resizing_type=fit)

The vertical ellipses menu includes different layout configurations you can choose from, including an option to use **Immersive View** with the selected viewport.

[![Viewport panes menu options in the toolbar.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8ed72bfe-c285-40f3-87ce-7ed1f060e74d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8ed72bfe-c285-40f3-87ce-7ed1f060e74d?resizing_type=fit)

The quick-toggle button switches between maximizing the currently selected viewport or switching to the selected layout configuration with multiple viewports displayed in the editor window.

[![Quick toggle menu icon on the toolbar.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9a56930a-df8c-48f8-9787-02d3f969e296?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9a56930a-df8c-48f8-9787-02d3f969e296?resizing_type=fit)

In this example, clicking the overlay toggle buttons will switch between the maximized and selected layout for the editor viewports.

### Viewport Toolbar Warning Indicators

When the interaction within a menu alters something critical that affects the viewport, such as a change that could cause visual or performative differences, actionable warning indicators appear in the viewport toolbar alongside the category they affect. This is helpful to indicate a change has occurred that can affect what you see in the viewport in some way.   

For example, when **Realtime Viewport** is disabled, the warning indicator can clue you into the fact that the viewport isn’t updating what you see, which can have unintended consequences.

When these indicators are shown, you can click them to rest the changed setting to its default state, in turn removing the warning.

[![Realtime viewport warning icon on the toolbar.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6165487c-14c4-4b98-9b30-485d798b92b0?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6165487c-14c4-4b98-9b30-485d798b92b0?resizing_type=fit)

### Other Editor Viewports

The **Viewport Toolbar** is adapted to different modes of the level editor and to the individual asset editors it has. 

The sections below are some examples of these differences. 

### Level Editor Viewport Modes

The level editor can be put into different **Modes** to enable specialized editing interfaces and workflows for editing particular types of actors and geometry within the viewport. 

You can change the level editor mode using the dropdown selection menu in the main toolbar.

[![Menu of categories you can select via the selection tool.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/362cc9db-7ea3-4eaf-9a42-980352a367e4?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/362cc9db-7ea3-4eaf-9a42-980352a367e4?resizing_type=fit)

These modes change the primary behavior of the level editor viewport for a specialized task, such as moving and transforming assets in the world, sculpting landscapes, generating foliage, animating objects, and more.

### Asset Editors

Individual **Asset Editors** use a viewport toolbar adapted to their editors and functionality within. 

In this example, you can see a comparison of the legacy viewport toolbar to the improved viewport toolbar.

[![Legacy editor under current toolbar for comparison.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b360a888-6082-4c24-8259-82f6c5b092b0?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b360a888-6082-4c24-8259-82f6c5b092b0?resizing_type=fit)

Below are examples of the different viewport toolbars you’ll see in different editors:

**Material / Material Instance Editor**

### Asset Editor Preview Scene Settings

**Asset Editor** viewports use a preview scene to display their assets. This scene can give you an idea of how that asset will look in a lit environment. You can change properties of the scene using the **Preview Scene Settings**. 

You can access a portion of these settings from the viewport toolbar by clicking its menu.

[![Asset editor preview scene menu settings.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/93b2c78b-9c28-405a-991b-759288e999ea?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/93b2c78b-9c28-405a-991b-759288e999ea?resizing_type=fit)

If you want to make additional changes to the scene in the viewport, select Preview Scene Settings from this menu to open the Preview Scene Settings panel, where you’ll have access to additional lighting, post process, and scene options.

### Materials and Material Instances Viewport Toolbars

The **Material** and **Material Instance** editors display a limited viewport toolbar. Since these editors are previewing a material and how it renders on an object within an environment, viewport controls found in other editors simply aren’t necessary here.

[![Materials options icons on the toolbar.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ed6f986c-88ab-4124-b145-c6c7177e913f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ed6f986c-88ab-4124-b145-c6c7177e913f?resizing_type=fit)

The notable difference between these editors and others is that **Preview Mesh** options are included in the viewport toolbar. You can choose one of the provided shapes, or select a custom mesh from the **Content Browser** to preview the material.
