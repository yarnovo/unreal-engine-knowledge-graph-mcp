This guide is designed for new users to Unreal Engine who want to get started animating as simply and quickly as possible. This guide will walk you through the steps of installing the engine, creating a project, and using some existing sample content to do so. 

Goals: 

-   Install Unreal Engine and set up a project using an existing sample
    
-   Animate a Control Rigged object using Sequencer
    
-   Make fine adjustments to keys of an animated sequence using animation tools
    
-   Add some lighting and rendering elements to the scene
    
-   Use Unreal Engine's Movie Render Pipeline to render out a final image or video sequence
