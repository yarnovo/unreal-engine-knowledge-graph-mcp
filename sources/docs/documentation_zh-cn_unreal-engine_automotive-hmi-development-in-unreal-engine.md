**Automotive Human-Machine Interface** **(HMI)** projects in **Unreal Engine** **(UE)** are highly-optimized mobile applications with many unique considerations. Vehicle controls and displays demand a high level of responsiveness, stability, and reliability, as failures in any of these areas can result in both frustration and safety issues for users. Additionally, HMI teams have a unique cross-disciplinary makeup, with developers from different industries and working environments all contributing to a project.

This section of the UE documentation provides guides tailored for automotive HMI projects, including:

-   Onboarding resources for HMI developers new to working with UE
    
-   Guidelines for achieving the high level of optimization and performance required for an HMI product
    
-   Guidelines for scaling an HMI project and collaborating between the unique disciplines and working environments that make up its industry
    

## Roles and Environments on an HMI Project

HMI projects for Unreal Engine (UE) have a unique cross-disciplinary environment. Your own organization's preferences may vary, but the following chart generalizes the typical UE HMI project's makeup:

Development Team

Number of Personnel

Discipline/Industry

Preferred Environment

Description

Technical Artists

2-5

Technical art, 3D art, CAD, DCC through Unreal Engine

Windows

Primarily works on visual assets, such as car models. This can include Rigging, Animation, Materials, effects, Blueprinting, UI/UMG, Rendering, Lighting,  Profiling, and other related work.

UI/UX Developers

2-5

UI design, web design, User Experience design

MacOS, Figma

Builds the UI and menus for the vehicle.

Integration Developers

10-15

Computer science, software development

Linux

Integrates the vehicle's systems with the UE application.

Quality Assurance Testers

\-

Computer science, software development

\-

Tests the application and provides feedback about bugs and features to the team.

The general workflow for these teams is as follows:

1.  Technical and 3D artists develop the art assets for the project, most especially car models, which are often displayed alongside technical information. This involves taking development assets and converting them into performance-focused models for a real-time application.
    
2.  UI and UX developers build the frontend UI for the project using Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG), UE's UI editor. This typically involves prototyping in Figma or another UI design suite, then re-creating the team's designs inside UMG.
    
3.  Integration developers work on the backend systems for the project, tying together the vehicle's systems, the project's application flow, and the assets provided by the UI and technical art teams. They also profile and debug the application, and provide technical feedback to the other teams so they can tweak their assets. This makes integration developers the central pillar of an HMI project's iterative workflow.
    
4.  The quality assurance team tests builds of the application and provides feedback about performance, bugs, and the overall user experience.
    
5.  Each of these teams continuously iterates on their respective pieces based on feedback from one another, correcting issues as they arise, tweaking the experience, and then testing again.
    

This makeup of teams introduces unique challenges for a UE project, as each of their industries prefers different operating systems and suites of software when working in other types of projects. Fortunately, UE supports each of these environments, and it is possible for this diverse group to collaborate.

## Manage Your Application's Performance

Automotive HMI projects must hit a high bar of reliability, responsiveness, and performance to ensure the smoothest and safest user experience possible. The resources in this section provide an introduction to the concepts governing performance in UE, and the tools you can use to profile and configure performance.
